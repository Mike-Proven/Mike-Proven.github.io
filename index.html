  <h2>Privacy Policies for Published Apps</h2>

  <p>I do intend to make apps for public use or just for this portfolio as listed below, and the privacy policy will go here, but the bottom line is that as far as I know, no one else will have access to your information (unless software used by apple or android phones or your web browser is taking it). I have no plans to monetize off of user data ever or use user data except for in app functionality. I believe in ethical business models that allow for privacy and make for a good user experience that extends past the limits of the app into your own personal rights and sovereignty.</p>

  <h2>ESL Web App</h2>
  <h3>Click here to go to <a href="esl.html">My ESL App</a> that I made when I was still learning to code using Javascript. </h3>
  <p>I made this for my older students to expand their vocabulary. At the time, this list of the 3,000 most used words in English would have covered 80% of all conversations and 70% of all written material in newspapers and magazines. Now, both the list and method of programming should be updated, but I'm not likely to do that any time soon. However it is still functional.</p>
